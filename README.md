# DU Data Science
Thoughts on an undergraduate major in data science at U of Denver

## Learning Objectives

1. Statistical acumen
    - Statistics and Probability at "baby" Casella/Berger level
    - Full quarter of regression at a minimum
    - Observational vs Experimental studies (causal inference)
2. Computational skills 
    - Focus on using computers as an integral tool
    - Fundamental computing concepts such as loops, iterators, memory allocation, etc. 
    - python based relying on Jupyter notebooks

## Market Research

1. Job market
2. Prep for grad school

## DU Constituents

Which departments/groups at DU should be included in DS conversations?

    - ??

## Other Universities

1. [Penn State](https://datasciences.psu.edu)
    - Intercollege major in data science that includes statistics, computer science, and information sciences
2. [Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu/undergraduate/interdepartmental-majors)
    - Interdepartmenal major including stats and CS
3. [UC Berkeley](https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs)
    - Maybe the gold standard
4. [Loyola Chicago](https://www.luc.edu/math/bsmathds.shtml)
    - Comparable in size to DU
5. [Colorado State University](https://www.natsci.colostate.edu/data-science/)
    - Just in the College of Natural Sciences with Math, Stats, and CS
    - Obviously the proximinity to DU is a little troubling
